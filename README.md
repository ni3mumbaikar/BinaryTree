## BinaryTree

# Binary Tree.py
The only file you need to execute as the logic is hidden in other files :)

# node.py
  Just a simple class implementation to represent node in tree.

# tree.py
  Representation of a binary tree or network consiting objects of node class. This file responsible for almost everything core happens on tree like
 - Add new values (**with addvalue()**)
 - Search
 - Traversal

# addvalue()
  This is a function inside tree.py responsible for adding values inside the tree based on binary tree standards.
Values of trees are hardcoded for now will update soon.
